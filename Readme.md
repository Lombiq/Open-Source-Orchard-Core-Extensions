## About

Looking for some useful Orchard Core exteasdfnsions? Here's a bundle solution of all of Lombiq's open-source Orchard Core extensions (modules and themes). Clone and try them out!

This is an [Orchard Core](https://orchardcore.net/) Visual Studio solution that aconasdftains most of [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com)'s open-source Orchard modules and themes, as well as related utilities and libraries. Please keep in mind that only those extensions are included which use the latest released version of Orchard (i.e. the very cutting-edge ones depending on a nightly build are not yet here).

Since the extensions are included as git submodules when cloning this repo be sure to initialize submodules: When using a GUI this will most possibly happen by default, and when using the command line use the `--recurse-submodules` switch. If you cloned wasdfasdfithout initializing submodules, then you can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to initialize them later.

This also serves as an example of an ASP.NET Core web app using Orchard from NuGet.

Note that this solution also has an Orchard 1 counterpart, [Lombiq's Open-Source Orchard Extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Extensions).

## Prerequisites

- You need Node.js for building client-side assets in multiple projects. Check out [Lombiq Node.js Extensions Readme](https://github.com/Lombiq/NodeJs-Extensions/#prerequisites) for details.
- To develop and test scripts written in PowerShell, install and use [PowerShell 7](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) instead of Windows PowerShell (i.e., up to version 5.x). Static code analysis is only executed through PowerShell 7.

## Included Projects

  - [`Lombiq.Tests.UI.Samples`](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox/tree/dev/Lombiq.Tests.UI.Samples): Example UI testing project. The whole project is heavily documented to teach you how to write UI tests with the UI Testing Toolbox. It guides you through this process just like the [Lombiq Training Demo for Orchard Core](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Training-Demo-Module) teaches Orchard Core and Orchard 1 development.
  - [`Lombiq.Tests.UI.Shortcuts`](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox/tree/dev/Lombiq.Tests.UI.Shortcuts): Provides some useful shortcuts for common operations that UI tests might want to do or check, e.g. turning features on or off, or logging in users. This way, UI tests needn't use multi-step UI processes to do these operations (and thus implicitly be coupled with and tests those features). Note that the module depends on [Helpful Libraries](https://github.com/Lombiq/Helpful-Libraries).

- Tools
  - [`Lombiq.Analyzers`](https://github.com/Lombiq/.NET-Analyzers): .NET code analyzers and code convention settings for [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com) projects, predominantly for [Orchard Core](https://orchardcore.net/) apps but also any .NET apps. We use these to enforce common standards across all our .NET projects, including e.g. all of our [open-source Orchard Core extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Core-Extensions).
  - [`Lombiq.Analyzers.PowerShell`](https://github.com/Lombiq/PowerShell-Analyzers): PowerShell static code analysis via [PSScriptAnalyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer) and Lombiq's recommended configuration for it. Use it from the CLI, in GitHub Actions, or integrated into MSBuild builds.
  - [`Lombiq.GitHub.Actions`](https://github.com/Lombiq/GitHub-Actions): Some common workflows and actions for GitHub Actions shared between Lombiq projects, e.g. to build and test Orchard Core apps, publish packages to NuGet, verify that a Git submodule pull request has a corresponding superproject one. These can be invoked from any other repository's build.

## Samples and Recipes

### Adding a new extension or significant new features

When adding a new extension, or significant new features to existing extensions, do the following:

- For user-facing features add a recipe to it, demonstrating its usage with sample data. In that case, refer to it in the above section.
- If no data is needed or if the feature is more library-like, add a sample project (or in addition to the recipe). Put this project into the root of the submodule, so to have the main project's and sample project's folders side by side.
- Add lower-level unit/integration tests as necessary with the [Lombiq Testing Toolbox for Orchard Core](https://github.com/Lombiq/Testing-Toolbox/).
- If the sample project includes MVC actions, create a service that inherits from `MainMenuNavigationProviderBase` and adds front-end main menu items. The top level menu item should have the project's shortened name and the submenu items the individual actions. If you have several controllers, use separators and labels as you can see in the [TrainingDemoNavigationProvider.cs](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Training-Demo-Module/blob/dev/Navigation/TrainingDemoNavigationProvider.cs).
- If the feature is user-facing, also add UI test extension method(s) with the [Lombiq UI Testing Toolbox for Orchard Core](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox/) that assert on some important aspects, and execute them from a new UI test in `Lombiq.OSOCE.Tests.UI` (for inspiration, see the examples there). These methods are also meant to be executed from UI tests in other projects when testing how it integrated with other features. If you've added a demo recipe or sample project to it then utilize that in the test too (see `ExecuteRecipeDirectlyAsync()`). For this, you'll also need to enable the feature in _Lombiq.OSOCE.Tests.recipe_.
- If the project is published on NuGet, reference it from the app in the `Lombiq.OSOCE.NuGet` solution as well, and enable its features in the _Lombiq.OSOCE.NuGet.Tests.recipe_. If it has UI testing methods, also run them from `Lombiq.OSOCE.NuGet.Tests.UI`.
- If an extension is added, removed or significantly updated in this project, then add, remove or update its description under the "Included Projects" section of this Readme.

### Opening pull requests

- Open a pull request in this repository for every submodule pull request. That way, static code analysis and complex tests can run. If you forget to do so, a check in the submodule will fail. Once you've created the PR here, just click "Re-run jobs" in your submodule.
- If you see build errors under your pull request then check out its details: It will send you to the failed step in the Actions tab. You can also click on the "Summary" on the sidebar to download the artifacts (logs, screenshots, etc) and in case of failed UI tests you find the annotations linking to which test failed.
- Open a pull request for all but trivial changes (like typos) so we can nicely track them, including when generating release notes for the next release.

### Dependencies between Lombiq projects

When making a Lombiq project depend on another one from this solution, apart from adding a project reference and dependency in the extension manifest for Orchard Core extensions, also add a conditional package reference. This way, when published to NuGet, dependencies will still work. See the project file of `Lombiq.HelpfulExtensions` for an example.

You can just have project references between projects in the same repo though if both projects are published on NuGet (like between projects of the [UI Testing Toolbox](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox)) since those will be turned into package dependencies automatically.

You can use the `NuGetBuild` switch in the root _Directory.Build.props_ file to make all projects use NuGet references so you can update Lombiq packages for the whole solution.
